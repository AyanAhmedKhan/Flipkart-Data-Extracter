**Flipkart Data Extractor Using Selenium, Python, Pandas, and BeautifulSoup**

In this project, I developed a web scraper to extract product data from Flipkart's e-commerce platform. The tool was built using **Selenium** for browser automation and **BeautifulSoup** for parsing HTML content, combined with **Pandas** to store and analyze the scraped data. Key functionalities included:

- **Web Automation**: Selenium was utilized to navigate Flipkart’s website, automate product searches, and load product listings dynamically, overcoming JavaScript-rendered content barriers.
  
- **Data Parsing and Extraction**: Using BeautifulSoup, I extracted key product information such as names, prices, ratings, and product details. The data was efficiently parsed and cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy.
  
- **Data Storage and Analysis**: The extracted data was stored in an Excel file using Pandas for easy analysis. Pandas' DataFrame allowed for further manipulation and exploration of the data for any required insights.

The Flipkart Data Extractor is a robust solution for real-time product data extraction, enabling detailed analysis and further processing of e-commerce data.
